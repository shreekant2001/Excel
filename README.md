# Excel      
This is a sales analysis Excel project that I made for my resume. It includes a sales data table with various sales metrics, such as product, salesperson, region, and sales volume. I used various formulas and functions to analyze the data and identify trends. I also created charts and graphs to visualize the data and make it easier to understand.
